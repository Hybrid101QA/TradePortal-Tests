# Valuewebb – Robot Framework QA Automation

This repository contains automated test scripts built with **Robot Framework** to validate key workflows for a simulated Trade Facilitation website focused on import and export operations.

## 🌐 Project Overview

**Valuewebb** is a QA automation project that simulates critical test cases within a trade portal environment, including:
- User Login and Dashboard Verification
- Import Form Submission
- Export Transaction Processing
- Document Uploads
- Logout and Session Management

This serves as a showcase for my manual and automation QA skills as part of my professional portfolio.
